### Announcing unlimited free private repos and unified Enterprise offering.

> taken from github blog

Today we’re announcing two major updates to make **GitHub more accessible to developers: unlimited free private repositories,** and a simpler, unified Enterprise offering. We’re excited about these updates to our Free and Enterprise offerings:

GitHub Free now includes unlimited private repositories. For the first time, developers can use GitHub for their private projects with up to three collaborators per repository for free. Many developers want to use private repos to apply for a job, work on a side project, or try something out in private before releasing it publicly. Starting today, those scenarios, and many more, are possible on GitHub at no cost. Public repositories are still free (of course—no changes there) and include unlimited collaborators.

GitHub Enterprise is the new unified product for Enterprise Cloud (formerly GitHub Business Cloud) and Enterprise Server (formerly GitHub Enterprise). Organizations that want the flexibility to use GitHub in a cloud or self-hosted configuration can now access both at one per-seat price. And with GitHub Connect, these products can be securely linked, providing a hybrid option so developers can work seamlessly across both environments.

**GitHub Pro** (formerly GitHub Developer) and GitHub Team are also available for developers and teams who need professional coding and collaboration features. And of course, open source contributors will still have everything they need to collaborate on public repositories, including our free version of GitHub Team.

Whether you’re a student about to write your first line of code, an enterprise leader with teams around the world, or an open source maintainer, we want GitHub to be the best place for you to code, collaborate, and connect with the global community of developers. Today’s changes are a big investment in the future of GitHub, and we’re excited to see what you build in 2019.

> Summary: Free Unlimited Private Repos but number of collaborators is restricted to 3 for these repos.
